## Introduction

I'm an MA student in General Linguistics in the [Master’s Programme in Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions/degree-programmes/linguistic-diversity-and-digital-humanities-masters-programme){:target="_blank"}) at the University of Helsinki. I hold a BA in General Linguistics with minors in Classics and European Union studies. 

My main study interests are _language and culture in contact, language change, historical and areal linguistics_, and _typology_. I'm also interested in _discourse analysis, language and power, intellectual history, linguistic minorities,_ and _nation and identity building_, _methodology_ and _multidisciplinary approaches_.

At the moment I’m writing my master’s thesis on the lexicalization patterns of perception verbs in the Circum-Baltic Area, combining my interests in areality, contact, and typology.

## Projects
[Measuring Language Distance Using Perplexity](https://raaoo.github.io/assets/documents/linguistic_distance.pdf){:target="_blank"}<br>
This was a group project I did for the course _Linguistics in the Digital Age_. My group used language modelling and perplexity measures to investigate linguistic distance between five closely related Romance languages. I was mainly responsible for the language modelling (Python+NLTK), making visualizations with R, and the LaTeX formatting of our report. 

[Webpage for the 2nd Student Conference of the MA Programme Linguistic Diversity in the Digital Age](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/lingda-conference/esimerkkisivu/){:target="_blank"}<br>
When I was working as a conference coordinator for the _LingDA Student Conference_, I was responsible for creating new visual materials for the conference website and updating the site.

[Schedule for the 45 Annual Conference of Linguistics/Kielitieteen päivät XLV](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/kielitieteenpaivat2018/files/2018/05/Ohjelmakartta_11.pdf){:target="_blank"}<br>
Scheduling and planning the programme was my main responsibility when I was working as a conference assistant for the _45 Annual Conference of Linguistics_, held in Helsinki in 2018. Planning the schedule was quite a puzzle, since the conference was organized in three locations and had over 100 presentations and workshops. When I was designing the schedule, I tried to make it as clear as possible while still being visually pleasing.

## Misc. 

I'm an amateur photographer since my early teens. I have photographed all the conferences where I have assisted - my photos were included in a [blog post about the conference Personal Names and Cultural Reconstructions](https://www.nordicsocioonomastics.org/the-conference-of-personal-names-and-cultural-reconstructions/){:target="_blank"}.
